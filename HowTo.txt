I created a class for Card to clarifiy the cards that each player plays down per round.
I also gave the card class a methos of isGreaterThan to help clarify which value is greater to 
determine the winner of the round.

I then created a class for deck to create the deck of cards.. or 52 different objects.
In the class I created a suits and values parameter and ran a for loop to pair each value to 
each suit. then I pushed 52 objects to the cards class.

I created a shuffle function and inside the function I created a new array of cards. This array
was called shuffledDeck.
